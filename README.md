## A Simple Shell Implementation in C
This project was developed during my first year of studying Computer Science as part of the requirements for the Operating Systems course. The objective was to create a simple command-line shell that supports basic shell commands and can execute external programs. 
The shell implements built-in commands such as cd, pwd, mkdir, rmdir, cat, cp and exit.
